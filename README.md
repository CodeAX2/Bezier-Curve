# Bezier-Curve
A cool way to show off the basics of vector graphics!

## About This Project
Vector graphics are unique in that they can be scaled to any size without 
the loss of data. This is due to the fact that they are constructed using
mathematical algorithims that remain consistent no matter the scale.
Using the quadratic curve algorithim, you can play around with a 
simple curve and get a feel for how vector graphics work.

## Things I Learned During Development
This application applies ideas learned from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BÃ©zier_curve
and required me to learn the basics of vector graphics in order to program it.
